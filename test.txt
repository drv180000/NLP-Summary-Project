This is a testing file for use in a summarization project. The following text is borrowed from the Wikipedia article for Ketchup which can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup:
Ketchup or catsup[note 1] is a table condiment with a sweet and sour flavor. "Ketchup" now typically refers to tomato ketchup,[6] although early recipes for different varieties contained mushrooms, oysters, mussels, egg whites, grapes, or walnuts, among other ingredients.[7][8]

Tomato ketchup is made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors vary but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, mustard and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger.[citation needed] The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and the United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[9][10] Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment for dishes that are usually served hot, and are fried or greasy: e.g., french fries and other potato dishes, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat.

Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips.[11]
